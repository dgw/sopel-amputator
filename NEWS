## Changelog

### 0.3.0

* Guess MIME type of links (by file extension, if present) and skip "safe" types
  that are probably not wrapped in AMP [#3]
  * Configurable with `skip_safe_filetypes` config setting.
* Added configuration for AMPutatorBot's "guess and check" function, both a
  global setting (`guess_and_check`) and a per-channel override (new `ampguess`
  command for chanops and bot admins) [#2]

Under the hood:
* Require _stable_ Sopel 8.x, no more pre-releases
* Updated package metadata & release workflow


### 0.2.1

* Added Twitter/X domains to default ignore list


### 0.2.0

Under-the-hood improvements:

* More robust domain matching against ignore list
  * Includes distinct log messages for exact matches vs. subdomain matches
* More granular error handling
* Better error logging
* Migrated package metadata from `setup.py`+`setup.cfg` to `pyproject.toml`


### 0.1.0

Initial release.

Pending conversion from `setup.py`+`setup.cfg` template to newer style package
using `pyproject.toml`—plus some other features on the todo list—but the basics
are here:

* Detect likely AMP links
* Call AmputatorBot API for the canonical URL of each suspected AMP link
* Skip links from a configurable list of ignored domains
* Silently fail if no better URL is found
